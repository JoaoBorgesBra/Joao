In the near future, I hope to develop skills that will make me a great professional, expanding my knowledge in graphic design and programming languages, and improving my teamwork and creativity. I desire to work in this field.

In the distant future, I aspire to work for large companies to broaden the scope of my work, participate in important projects, and as a resulting build a strong portfolio while being recognized for my skills.
